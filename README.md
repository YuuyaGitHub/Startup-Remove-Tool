# Startup Remove Tool
This is a tool that removes all startups in the registry and folders.
<br>Task scheduler and UWP startup will not be removed. I have no knowledge :)

# How to use
It's very simple, just "run as administrator".
<br>It will be automatically deleted as soon as it is executed, so there is no need for troublesome work.
